    \item \textbf{Water Thresholds:} If the volume of remaining water is less than 10 ml, the wiper is OFF; if the volume of remaining water is less than 15 ml but exceeds 10 ml, the wiper works in SLOW mode; if the volume of remaining water exceeds 15 ml, the wiper works in FAST mode.
    \item \textbf{Wiper Speed:} If the wiper works in SLOW mode, 50\% remaining water is wiped out; if the wiper works in FAST mode, 80\% remaining water is wiped out.
